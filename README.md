Query **HIPAA, CCPA, and SOX** — with more US regulations coming soon — directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're building healthcare tech, consumer apps, or financial services for the US market, this is your compliance reference.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) — Stockholm, Sweden

## Why This Exists

US compliance is scattered across regulations.gov PDFs, eCFR.gov pages, state legislative sites, and agency guidance documents. Whether you're:
- A **developer** implementing HIPAA security controls or CCPA consumer rights
- A **product team** navigating breach notification requirements across multiple states
- A **compliance officer** mapping NIST controls to regulatory obligations
- A **legal researcher** comparing incident response timelines across federal and state laws

...you shouldn't need to navigate fragmented federal agencies, 50 state legislatures, and conflicting PDF formats. Ask Claude. Get the exact section. With context.

This MCP server makes US regulations **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## 🎬 See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All regulatory text is ingested from official sources (eCFR.gov, California LegInfo)
- Snippets are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing — the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations
- **Note:** HTML-to-text conversion normalizes whitespace/formatting, but preserves content

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns **32-token snippets** with highlighted matches (safe for context)
- Section retrieval warns about token usage (some sections can be large)
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
eCFR/LegInfo HTML → Parse → SQLite → FTS5 snippet() → MCP response
                      ↑                    ↑
               Formatting only      Verbatim database query
```

### Example: regulations.gov vs. This MCP

| regulations.gov / eCFR | This MCP Server |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Search by CFR citation | Search by plain English: *"breach notification timeline"* |
| Navigate fragmented agency sites | Get the exact section with context |
| Manual cross-referencing across federal/state | `compare_requirements` tool does it instantly |
| "Which regulations apply to me?" → weeks of research | `check_applicability` tool → answer in seconds |
| Copy-paste from PDFs with formatting issues | Section + definitions + related requirements |
| Check eCFR, regulations.gov, 50 state sites | Unified search across all sources |
| No API for most sources | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**regulations.gov example:** Download HIPAA PDF → Ctrl+F "breach" → Read §164.410 → Google "What's a 'reportable breach'?" → Cross-reference CCPA → Check California site → Repeat for SOX

**This MCP:** *"Compare breach notification requirements across HIPAA, CCPA, and SOX"* → Done.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Legal Advice

> **🚨 THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE 🚨**
>
> Regulation text is sourced verbatim from eCFR.gov, California LegInfo, and other official public sources. However:
> - **Control mappings** (NIST 800-53, NIST CSF) are interpretive aids, not official guidance
> - **Applicability rules** are generalizations, not legal determinations
> - **Cross-references** are research helpers, not compliance mandates
>
> **Always verify against official sources and consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.**

### Token Usage

> **⚠️ Context Window Warning**
>
> Some regulation sections can be large (e.g., HIPAA Privacy Rule sections with extensive commentary). The MCP server:
> - **Search tool**: Returns smart snippets (safe for context)
> - **Get section tool**: Returns full text (may consume significant tokens)
> - **Recommendation**: Use search first, then fetch specific sections as needed
>
> Claude Desktop has a 200k token context window. Monitor your usage when retrieving multiple large sections.

### MVP Status

> **📋 Initial Release**
>
> This is a production-ready MVP with three foundational regulations (HIPAA, CCPA, SOX). The database schema and all 9 MCP tools are fully functional and thoroughly tested (100% test coverage).
>
> **Data Ingestion**: Automated ingestion from official API sources (eCFR.gov, California LegInfo) is operational. Additional regulations are being added to the database.
>
> **Coming Soon**: Additional federal regulations (GLBA, FERPA, FISMA) and state breach notification laws.

### NIST Standards

**No copyrighted NIST standards are included.** Control mappings reference NIST 800-53 control IDs only (e.g., "AC-1", "SI-4"). While NIST standards are freely available from NIST, this tool helps map regulations to controls but doesn't replace reading the standards themselves.

## Architecture Overview

### Database

The server uses SQLite with FTS5 (full-text search) for efficient querying:

- **regulations** - Metadata for each regulation
- **sections** - Regulation sections with full text
- **sections_fts** - FTS5 index for fast full-text search
- **definitions** - Official term definitions
- **control_mappings** - NIST control to regulation mappings
- **applicability_rules** - Sector applicability rules
- **source_registry** - Data source tracking for updates

### Ingestion Framework

The ingestion framework uses an adapter pattern to normalize data from multiple US regulatory sources:

- **eCFR.gov API** - Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (HIPAA, SOX)
- **California LegInfo API** - State legislation (CCPA/CPRA)
- **regulations.gov API** - Federal regulatory documents
- **Agency-specific sources** - HHS, SEC, FTC guidance

Each adapter handles source-specific pagination, authentication, and data normalization.

### MCP Protocol

The server implements the Model Context Protocol specification:

- **stdio transport** for Claude Desktop integration
- **Centralized tool registry** for consistent tool definitions
- **Structured error handling** with informative messages
- **Token-efficient responses** with snippet highlighting

## About Ansvar Systems

We build AI-accelerated threat modeling and compliance tools for automotive, financial services, and healthcare. This MCP server started as our internal reference tool for US regulations — turns out everyone building for US markets has the same compliance research frustrations.

So we're open-sourcing it. Navigating federal and state regulations shouldn't require a legal team.
