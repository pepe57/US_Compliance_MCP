## Why This Exists

US compliance is scattered across regulations.gov PDFs, eCFR.gov pages, state legislative sites, and agency guidance documents. Whether you're:
- A **developer** implementing HIPAA security controls or CCPA consumer rights
- A **product team** navigating breach notification requirements across multiple states
- A **compliance officer** mapping NIST controls to regulatory obligations
- A **legal researcher** comparing incident response timelines across federal and state laws

...you shouldn't need to navigate fragmented federal agencies, 50 state legislatures, and conflicting PDF formats. Ask Claude. Get the exact section. With context.

This MCP server makes US regulations **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## 🎬 See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All regulatory text is ingested from official sources (eCFR.gov, California LegInfo)
- Snippets are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing — the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations
- **Note:** HTML-to-text conversion normalizes whitespace/formatting, but preserves content

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns **32-token snippets** with highlighted matches (safe for context)
- Section retrieval warns about token usage (some sections can be large)
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
eCFR/LegInfo HTML → Parse → SQLite → FTS5 snippet() → MCP response
                      ↑                    ↑
               Formatting only      Verbatim database query
```

### Example: regulations.gov vs. This MCP

| regulations.gov / eCFR | This MCP Server |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Search by CFR citation | Search by plain English: *"breach notification timeline"* |
| Navigate fragmented agency sites | Get the exact section with context |
| Manual cross-referencing across federal/state | `compare_requirements` tool does it instantly |
| "Which regulations apply to me?" → weeks of research | `check_applicability` tool → answer in seconds |
| Copy-paste from PDFs with formatting issues | Section + definitions + related requirements |
| Check eCFR, regulations.gov, 50 state sites | Unified search across all sources |
| No API for most sources | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**regulations.gov example:** Download HIPAA PDF → Ctrl+F "breach" → Read §164.410 → Google "What's a 'reportable breach'?" → Cross-reference CCPA → Check California site → Repeat for SOX

**This MCP:** *"Compare breach notification requirements across HIPAA, CCPA, and SOX"* → Done.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Legal Advice

> **🚨 THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE 🚨**
>
> This tool provides regulatory text for research and educational purposes. However:
> - **Control mappings** (NIST 800-53, NIST CSF) are interpretive guidance, NOT official HHS, NIST, or agency crosswalks
> - **Applicability rules** are generalizations, not legal determinations
> - **Cross-references** are research helpers, not compliance mandates
>
> **Always verify against official sources and consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.**

### Data Source Transparency

> **📋 Source Quality Disclosure**
>
> **Tier 1 - Official API Sources (Authoritative):**
> - HIPAA, GLBA, FERPA, COPPA, FDA 21 CFR 11, EPA RMP — sourced from **eCFR.gov official API**
> - CCPA/CPRA — sourced from **California LegInfo official site**
>
> **Tier 2 - Official State Sources (HTML Scraping):**
> - Virginia CDPA — sourced from law.lis.virginia.gov
> - Connecticut CTDPA — sourced from cga.ct.gov
> - Utah UCPA — sourced from le.utah.gov
> - Colorado CPA — seed data verified against leg.colorado.gov
>
> **Tier 3 - Seed Data (Verified but Static):**
> - FFIEC IT Handbook — examination guidance extracted from ffiec.gov booklets
> - NYDFS 500 — regulatory text from dfs.ny.gov
> - SOX — statute and SEC implementing regulations
>
> Seed data sources include official source attribution and verification dates. Users should check official sources for updates.
>
> **Control Framework Mappings:** HIPAA-to-NIST and CCPA-to-NIST mappings are interpretive guidance to assist compliance research. They are NOT official agency crosswalks. Consult NIST SP 800-66 and official agency guidance for authoritative mappings.

### Token Usage

> **⚠️ Context Window Warning**
>
> Some regulation sections can be large (e.g., HIPAA Privacy Rule sections with extensive commentary). The MCP server:
> - **Search tool**: Returns smart snippets (safe for context)
> - **Get section tool**: Returns full text (may consume significant tokens)
> - **Recommendation**: Use search first, then fetch specific sections as needed
>
> Claude Desktop has a 200k token context window. Monitor your usage when retrieving multiple large sections.

### MVP Status

> **📋 Initial Release**
>
> This is a production-ready MVP with three foundational regulations (HIPAA, CCPA, SOX). The database schema and all 9 MCP tools are fully functional and thoroughly tested (100% test coverage).
>
> **Data Ingestion**: Automated ingestion from official API sources (eCFR.gov, California LegInfo) is operational. Additional regulations are being added to the database.
>
> **Coming Soon**: Additional federal regulations (GLBA, FERPA, FISMA) and state breach notification laws.

### NIST Standards

**No copyrighted NIST standards are included.** Control mappings reference NIST 800-53 control IDs only (e.g., "AC-1", "SI-4"). While NIST standards are freely available from NIST, this tool helps map regulations to controls but doesn't replace reading the standards themselves.

## Architecture Overview

### Database

The server uses SQLite with FTS5 (full-text search) for efficient querying:

- **regulations** - Metadata for each regulation
- **sections** - Regulation sections with full text
- **sections_fts** - FTS5 index for fast full-text search
- **definitions** - Official term definitions
- **control_mappings** - NIST control to regulation mappings
- **applicability_rules** - Sector applicability rules
- **source_registry** - Data source tracking for updates

### Ingestion Framework

The ingestion framework uses an adapter pattern to normalize data from multiple US regulatory sources:

- **eCFR.gov API** - Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (HIPAA, SOX)
- **California LegInfo API** - State legislation (CCPA/CPRA)
- **regulations.gov API** - Federal regulatory documents
- **Agency-specific sources** - HHS, SEC, FTC guidance

Each adapter handles source-specific pagination, authentication, and data normalization.

### MCP Protocol

The server implements the Model Context Protocol specification:

- **stdio transport** for Claude Desktop integration
- **Centralized tool registry** for consistent tool definitions
- **Structured error handling** with informative messages
- **Token-efficient responses** with snippet highlighting

## Directory Review Notes

### Testing Account and Sample Data

This server is read-only and does not require a login account for functional review.
For directory review, use the bundled dataset and these sample prompts:
- *"What are HIPAA access control requirements?"*
- *"Compare HIPAA and CCPA breach notification timelines."*
- *"List regulations applicable to healthcare providers."*

### Remote Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

The default server runtime is read-only and can be deployed without authentication.
If you deploy a remote authenticated endpoint, use OAuth 2.0 over TLS with certificates from recognized authorities.

### Troubleshooting

- If startup fails, verify `US_COMPLIANCE_DB_PATH` points to a readable SQLite file.
- If HTTP tool calls fail, confirm `/mcp` POST routing and `mcp-session-id` header forwarding.
- If results are empty, call `list_regulations` first to verify dataset initialization.
