## search_regulations

Search across all US regulations using full-text search. Returns relevant sections with highlighted snippets.

**Token Efficiency**: Returns 32-token snippets with `>>>` `<<<` markers around matched terms to minimize token usage while preserving context.

### Input Schema

```json
{
  "query": "string (required)",
  "regulations": ["array of strings (optional)"],
  "limit": "number (optional, default: 10, max: 1000)"
}
```

### Parameters

- **query** (required): Search query. Supports natural language and technical terms.
  - Examples: "breach notification", "access controls", "risk assessment"

- **regulations** (optional): Filter results to specific regulations.
  - Values: `["HIPAA"]`, `["CCPA"]`, `["SOX"]`, or combinations
  - Default: Search all regulations

- **limit** (optional): Maximum number of results to return.
  - Default: 10
  - Max: 1000
  - Recommendation: Use lower limits (10-20) for focused queries

### Output Example

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "regulation": "HIPAA",
      "section": "164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)",
      "title": "Risk Analysis",
      "snippet": "...conduct an accurate and thorough >>>assessment<<< of the potential >>>risks<<< and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality...",
      "rank": 0.95
    },
    {
      "regulation": "CCPA",
      "section": "1798.150",
      "title": "Personal Information Breach",
      "snippet": "...consumer whose >>>personal information<<< was subject to a >>>breach<<< may institute a civil action...",
      "rank": 0.87
    }
  ],
  "total": 2,
  "query": "breach assessment risks"
}
```

### Token Usage Notes

- Snippets limited to ~32 tokens each
- Use `limit` parameter to control response size
- For large result sets, consider narrowing your query or using `regulations` filter

### Example Queries

```
# General search
"incident response procedures"

# Regulation-specific search
query: "audit logs"
regulations: ["HIPAA"]

# Multi-regulation comparison
query: "data retention"
regulations: ["HIPAA", "SOX"]
limit: 20
```

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Token Usage Notes

- Detailed structure can be 1000+ tokens for regulations with many sections
- Use this tool first to understand what's available

### Example Queries

```
# List all available regulations
{}

# Get HIPAA structure
{ "regulation": "HIPAA" }

# Get CCPA structure
{ "regulation": "CCPA" }
```

---

## compare_requirements

```json
{
  "topic": "string (required)",
  "regulations": ["array of strings (required)"]
}
```

### Parameters

- **topic** (required): Topic to compare across regulations
  - Examples: "breach notification", "access controls", "data retention"

- **regulations** (required): List of regulations to compare
  - Minimum: 2 regulations

### Output Example

```json
{
  "topic": "breach notification",
  "comparison": [
    {
      "regulation": "HIPAA",
      "sections": [
        {
          "section": "164.404",
          "title": "Notification to individuals",
          "snippet": "...notify each individual whose >>>unsecured protected health information<<< has been...>>>breached<<<...",
          "relevance": 0.98
        },
        {
          "section": "164.406",
          "title": "Notification to the Secretary",
          "snippet": "...>>>breach<<< of >>>unsecured<<< protected health information involving more than 500 individuals...",
          "relevance": 0.89
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "regulation": "CCPA",

      ]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_sections": 3,
    "regulations_compared": 2
  }
}
```

### Token Usage Notes

- Returns top 3-5 sections per regulation
- Total token usage scales with number of regulations compared
- Use specific topics for more focused results

### Example Queries

  "topic": "breach notification",
  "regulations": ["HIPAA", "CCPA"]
}

# Compare access controls
{
  "topic": "access controls authentication",
  "regulations": ["HIPAA", "SOX"]

{
  "topic": "incident response",
  "regulations": ["HIPAA", "CCPA", "SOX"]
}
```

### Example Control IDs

**NIST 800-53**:
- `AC-1` - Access Control Policy and Procedures
- `AU-2` - Event Logging
- `RA-1` - Risk Assessment Policy and Procedures
- `SC-7` - Boundary Protection
- `IR-1` - Incident Response Policy and Procedures

**NIST CSF**:
- `PR.AC-1` - Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked
- `DE.AE-1` - Network baseline established and managed
- `RS.RP-1` - Response plan is executed during or after an incident
- `ID.RA-1` - Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented

## Notes

### Token Optimization

All tools are designed for token efficiency:

- Search results use 32-token snippets with highlight markers
- Large sections are automatically truncated with warnings
- Use `limit` parameters to control response size
- Filter by regulation to reduce cross-regulation noise

### Error Handling

All tools return structured errors:

```json
{
  "error": "Section not found",
  "regulation": "HIPAA",
  "section": "999.999",
  "suggestion": "Use list_regulations to see available sections"
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start broad, narrow down**: Use `list_regulations` and `search_regulations` first
2. **Use filters**: Specify `regulation` parameter when you know which regulation applies
3. **Batch queries**: For `get_compliance_action_items`, process related sections together
4. **Chain tools**: Use search → get_section → get_compliance_action_items workflow
5. **Check applicability first**: Use `check_applicability` before deep-diving into regulations
