## Update Frequency

### MVP (Manual Updates)

**Current Status**: Database initialized with schema, placeholder adapters

**Update Process**:
1. Manual ingestion script execution
2. Human review of changes
3. Version bump and release

**Frequency**: As needed for major regulatory changes

### Post-MVP (Automated Updates)

**Planned Timeline**: Q2 2026

**Automated Processes**:

1. **Daily Freshness Checks**
   - GitHub Actions cron job (6 AM UTC daily)
   - Check all data sources for updates
   - Create GitHub issue if changes detected

2. **Source-Specific Update Detection**:

   **ecfr.gov (HIPAA)**:
   - Check CFR revision dates daily
   - eCFR updates from Federal Register
   - Typical update frequency: Daily technical updates, annual major revisions

   **California LegInfo (CCPA)**:
   - Query bill history for Civil Code §1798 amendments
   - Track legislative session updates
   - Typical update frequency: Annually (legislative sessions)

   **regulations.gov (SOX/Federal)**:
   - Query by regulation ID with `lastModifiedDate` filter
   - Track SEC rule amendments
   - Typical update frequency: Rarely (SOX stable, occasional SEC rule updates)

3. **Update Workflow**:
   ```
   Daily Check → Changes Detected → GitHub Issue → Human Review → Approve → Auto-Ingest → Test → Release
   ```

4. **Version Management**:
   - Patch version: Minor text corrections, clarifications
   - Minor version: New sections, significant amendments
   - Major version: New regulations added, breaking schema changes

### Expected Update Cadence (Post-MVP)

| Regulation | Typical Update Frequency | Detection Method |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| HIPAA | 1-2 times/year (guidance updates) | eCFR API revision dates |
| CCPA | Annually (legislative amendments) | CA LegInfo bill tracking |
| SOX | Rarely (law stable since 2010) | regulations.gov API |
| State Privacy | Annually (legislative sessions) | State legislature APIs |
| NIST Guidance | Quarterly (SP publications) | NIST CSRC RSS feeds |

---

## Data Sources

### Primary Official Sources

| Regulation | Source | API/Format | Documentation | Rate Limits |
|------------|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| HIPAA | ecfr.gov | XML/JSON REST API | [eCFR API v1](https://www.ecfr.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1) | No API key required, 1000 req/hour |
| CCPA | leginfo.legislature.ca.gov | HTML + Structured API | [CA LegInfo](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/) | No API key, reasonable use |
| SOX | SEC.gov + regulations.gov | HTML/JSON API | [SEC API](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation), [Regulations.gov API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/) | regulations.gov requires free API key |

### API Key Requirements

**Required**:
- regulations.gov - Free API key from [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/signup/)

**Not Required**:
- ecfr.gov - Open API
- California LegInfo - Open access

### Data Quality Assurance

**Ingestion Validation**:
1. **Section Count Verification**: Compare parsed sections to expected count
2. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all internal references resolve
3. **Completeness Scoring**:
   - Complete: All expected sections parsed, <5% missing cross-refs
   - Review: 90-99% sections parsed
   - Incomplete: <90% sections parsed

**Quality Metrics** (Planned):
```sql
SELECT
  regulation,
  sections_expected,
  sections_parsed,
  (sections_parsed * 100.0 / sections_expected) as completeness_pct,
  quality_status
FROM source_registry;
```

Expected output (post-MVP):
```
HIPAA  | 180 | 178 | 98.9% | review
CCPA   |  98 |  98 | 100%  | complete
SOX    |  52 |  48 | 92.3% | review
```

**Manual Review Triggers**:
- Completeness <95%
- New sections added (potential breaking changes)
- Sections removed (deprecated provisions)
- Major text changes (>50% diff)

### Data Freshness

**MVP Status**: Static snapshot at release time

**Post-MVP**: Database includes last_fetched timestamps

```sql
SELECT
  regulation,
  last_fetched,
  datetime('now') - last_fetched as days_since_update
FROM source_registry;
```

Target freshness: <7 days for all regulations
