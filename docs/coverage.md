### Primary Official Sources

| Regulation | Source | API/Format | Documentation | Rate Limits |
|------------|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| HIPAA | ecfr.gov | XML/JSON REST API | [eCFR API v1](https://www.ecfr.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1) | No API key required, 1000 req/hour |
| CCPA | leginfo.legislature.ca.gov | HTML + Structured API | [CA LegInfo](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/) | No API key, reasonable use |
| SOX | SEC.gov + regulations.gov | HTML/JSON API | [SEC API](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation), [Regulations.gov API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/) | regulations.gov requires free API key |

### API Key Requirements

**Required**:
- regulations.gov - Free API key from [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/signup/)

**Not Required**:
- ecfr.gov - Open API
- California LegInfo - Open access

### Data Quality Assurance

**Ingestion Validation**:
1. **Section Count Verification**: Compare parsed sections to expected count
2. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all internal references resolve
3. **Completeness Scoring**:
   - Complete: All expected sections parsed, <5% missing cross-refs
   - Review: 90-99% sections parsed
   - Incomplete: <90% sections parsed

**Quality Metrics** (Planned):
```sql
SELECT
  regulation,
  sections_expected,
  sections_parsed,
  (sections_parsed * 100.0 / sections_expected) as completeness_pct,
  quality_status
FROM source_registry;
```

Expected output (post-MVP):
```
HIPAA  | 180 | 178 | 98.9% | review
CCPA   |  98 |  98 | 100%  | complete
SOX    |  52 |  48 | 92.3% | review
```

**Manual Review Triggers**:
- Completeness <95%
- New sections added (potential breaking changes)
- Sections removed (deprecated provisions)
- Major text changes (>50% diff)

### Data Freshness

**MVP Status**: Static snapshot at release time

**Post-MVP**: Database includes last_fetched timestamps

```sql
SELECT
  regulation,
  last_fetched,
  datetime('now') - last_fetched as days_since_update
FROM source_registry;
```

Target freshness: <7 days for all regulations

## Contributing to Coverage

### How to Request New Regulations

1. Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ansvar-systems/us-regulations-mcp/issues)
2. Use the "New Regulation Request" template
3. Provide:
   - Regulation name and citation
   - Official data source URL
   - Use case / why it's needed
   - Estimated section count
   - Your industry/sector

### Priority Criteria

Regulations prioritized by:
1. **Applicability breadth**: How many organizations are subject to it?
2. **Data availability**: Is there a structured API or machine-readable source?
3. **User demand**: How many requests have we received?
4. **Complementarity**: Does it fill a gap in existing coverage?
5. **Implementation complexity**: How difficult is the ingestion adapter?

### Community Contributions

We welcome:
- New regulation adapters (see `src/ingest/adapters/`)
- Control framework mappings (expert review appreciated)
- Applicability rules for specific sectors
- Improved search queries and test cases
- Documentation improvements

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
